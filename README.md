# Customer_behavior_analysis
# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data analytics workflow**, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and business intelligence reporting. The goal is to extract actionable insights from raw data and present them through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, a detailed **analysis report**, and a **presentation deck**.

This project is designed to showcase practical skills expected from a **Data Analyst**, including Python, SQL, and data visualization.
